## What can I do?
### I am a bot-moderator...
I keep track of the `warnings` and automatically `ban members` when the maximum amount of warnings has been reached.

Promote me to `admin` and `/warn` the bad guy by replying to his message or by mentioning `@bad_guy` in your command.<br/>
I will ban users who receive more than a certain number of warnings (See: [MaxWarnings](/TelegramWarnBot/Data/Configuration.json#L3)).<br/><br/>
The default value of [MaxWarnings](/TelegramWarnBot/Data/Configuration.json#L3) is 2, which means that the user will be banned on his 3rd warning.<br/>
